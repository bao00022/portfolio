## Development Notes
### Learning Bootstrap
One of the biggest challenges I faced during the development process was breaking away from my habit of writing traditional CSS and adapting to Bootstrap's system. At first, I found it difficult to rely on Bootstrap classes instead of custom CSS. To overcome this, I started referring to the official Bootstrap documentation before building each module, aiming to fully understand the built-in utilities and reduce my use of manual CSS.

### Layout Comparison
This approach helped me a lot, especially with layout structures like Flexbox and columns. I actually built two versions—one using Flex manually, and another using Bootstrap's grid system—and the comparison made me realize how powerful and efficient Bootstrap's column system can be when used properly.

### Design Approach
In terms of design thinking, although I started from a mobile-first approach as usual, this time I became more aware of the importance of considering mobile and tablet layouts simultaneously. Thinking about both early on helped me make better decisions that work across different screen sizes.


## Key Features
- Responsive design that works across all device sizes
- Bootstrap-based grid system for efficient layouts
- Mobile-first approach with tablet consideration
- Optimized image loading for different screen sizes
